## About this repository  :
This repository includes my work on the IoT track during my training program at Smart Methods Company
## task 1 : Programming voice chat systems ( chat bot ) 
In this task, the audio is heard in the Arabic language and converted into written speech, and codes that work on this are attached to the files.
## task 2 : Wasdom ESP32 segment operation algorithm 
1. Download the Aurdino IDE
2. We add from the boards a link ESP32
3. We download the ESP32 board
4. After downloading the ESP32, we connect the ESP32 piece to a USB cable
5. When you turn on the ESP light, we go to Examples, then BASICS, then BLINK
6. Play Hardwie Connected with Web API
## Task 3 : Web Serial 
WebSerial is a Serial Monitor for ESP8266 & ESP32 Microcontrollers that can be accessed remotely via a web browser. Webpage is stored in program memory of the microcontroller.

# Upgrade to Pro
Checkout the Pro version of the WebSerial library which comes with enhanced & snappy UI, along with 'clear' & 'lock scroll' buttons on the monitor interface. Best of all, it's only 10KB in size compared to 50KB of regular WebSerial.
# Features
- Works on Websockets
- Realtime logging
- Any number of Serial Monitors can be opened on the browser
- Uses Async Webserver for better performance
